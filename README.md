# foodspan-app

This was an app built with Ionic v1 for FoodSpan, a project for the SHAD 2016 DE Cup.

As a note, this app is no longer functional: the API endpoints are no longer available. That being said, it's not a bad example of what went wrong (and the few things that went right) in our build process.
